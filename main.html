    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficient of an algorithm based on the amount of time it takes to run. As algorithms process larger input sizes, the time they require can significantly impact their usability. An algorithm with better time complexity completes its task in a shorter period, making it efficient and desirable for various applications.</p>
    
    <p>Space Complexity and O(n), on the other hand, evaluates the memory or space an algorithm needs to solve a problem. It's denoted as 'O(n)' where 'n' represents the input size. Efficient use of memory is crucial to prevent memory overflow or excessive resource consumption. <b>Space Complexity</b> becomes particularly vital in scenarios where resources are limited, and optimizing memory usage directly contributes to an algorithm's performance.</p>
